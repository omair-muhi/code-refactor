# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

Re-factor code-base to meet web accessibility standards.

## Description

The goal of this work was to take an existing code-base and improve the accessibility of the code-base and re-organize the code and make it more readable by adding developer comments to the code. This was done by following the acceptance criteria accompanying the user-story for this project. Multiple passes were made through the code to incrementally satisfy the acceptance criteria. Once one or more major acceptance criteria was achieved, a separate git-commit was used to update the code-base. Towards the end of the project, the final version of the web-page was hosted via GitHub pages.
